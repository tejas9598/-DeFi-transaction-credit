# ðŸ“Š Aave Wallet Credit Score Analysis

This report analyzes the score distribution and wallet behaviors based on historical Aave V2 transactions.

---

## ðŸ§  Method Overview

Each wallet was evaluated using a rule-based scoring engine that considered:

- Total USD value transacted
- Types of actions performed (borrow, repay, deposit, etc.)
- Transaction frequency (txns/day)
- Duration of activity (first to last transaction)
- Behavioral patterns (e.g., only deposits, short lifespan)

Credit scores range from **0 to 1000**, where:

- Higher scores = healthy, consistent borrowing and repayment behavior
- Lower scores = risky, single-use, or passive activity
